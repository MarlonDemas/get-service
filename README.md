# WIMT Hackathon

## Description

```
Finding effective ways to use the WhereIsMyTransport API to help commutors
```

## Concept

### Get Service


- Get Service is a webapp that creates a link between handymen and other freelancers and their clients, where it is necessary, as part of the work to travel to a work site.

- The app plots the most efficient public transport route and factors the travel costs into the cost of the service.

- It's a solution to the issue the of lack of transparency in this field, while also addressing issues such as unemployment and lack of access to transport. 

- We hope to use the Google Places API to cater to handymen who need to factor in stops to stock up on equipment along their route.
